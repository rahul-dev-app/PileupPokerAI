# PileupPokerAI

I've come across this new game called Pileup Poker on Puzzmo: https://www.puzzmo.com/game/pile-up-poker
I highly encourage to visit their website and try the game, its fun!

In the game, players place cards on a grid to form poker hands. Hands are counted in rows, columns and corners.
Objective of the game is to be able to obtain the maximum score given the draws.
Miniature version of the game consists of 4 turns and a 4x4 grid. Each turn a player draws 5 cards, places 4 cards
on the grid and discards one card. 

This is my attempt to create an AI agent to play the game and understanding the game's best strategies.
